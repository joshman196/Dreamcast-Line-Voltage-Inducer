# Dreamcast Line Voltage Inducer
PCBs designed to induce some voltage or something in to a telephone line to play Dreamcast games online. It's intended use case is to be hidden inside of a generic RJ11 coupler with the battery snap/barrel jack coming out of a hole and is tested for this purpose, but should be able to work on the method of cutting an RJ11 cable and soldering the red wires to the PCB.
## Parts Required
### Surface Mount PCBs
- 1x 0.47uF 50v 0805 Ceramic Capacitor
- 1x 360 Ohm 0805 Resistor

And either:
- 1x 9v Battery Snap - [Like this,](https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Connector-Plastic-Experiment-Equipment/dp/B08SL9X2YC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=N0CYSUL2AVQV&keywords=9v%2Bbattery%2Bsnap&qid=1692324833&sprefix=9v%2Bbattery%2Bsna%2Caps%2C199&sr=8-3&th=1) but you can probably get it cheaper elsewhere
### OR
- 1x 2.1mm Barrel Pigtail Cable - [This is the one I used](https://www.ledsupply.com/accessories/dc-barrel-plug-pigtail-cable)
If you have a PAL console and you want to use the battery method, you will need 2 9v Battery Snaps.
